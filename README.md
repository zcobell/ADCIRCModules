# ADCIRCModules
Implementation of routines used to manipulate ADCIRC model files in C++. The code provides a C++ interface as well as a Python interface.

## Python
When the python interface is compiled, you will have a PyAdcirc library file. For windows, this will by `PyAdcirc.dll` and for Linux type systems this will be `_PyAdcirc.so`. In addition to the library, you will see `PyAdcirc.py`. CMake will attempt to install these files to the appropriate directory, however, the user can change this. The standard library (`adcircmodules.dll` or `libadcircmodules.so` is also required to be in a location where it can be found at runtime (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Unix systems).

```
import PyAdcirc
m = PyAdcirc.Mesh("mymesh.grd")
m.read()
```
## Documentation
There is a Doxygen site available [Here](http://zcobell.github.io/ADCIRCModules/). The documentation is not yet complete, however, it is slowly progressing. The Python interface is not explicitly documentated, however, the Python interaction is generated using SWIG, so the function calls are identical. 

## Compiling
The build system for this project is CMake

### Submodules
Submodules are used in this project. You should initialize the repository using:
